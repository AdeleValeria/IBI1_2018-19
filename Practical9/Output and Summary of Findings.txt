According to the result, human and mouse share nearly 90% of the genome. I think this similarity makes mouse a good animal model for research, especially in understanding human diseases by modifying mouse DNA. The BLOSUM62 score for human- mouse is also very high (1091) in comparison to human-random (-250) and mouse-random (-250). The higher number of identical amino acids in the sequences, the higher BLOSUM62 score. Why? Because the BLOSUM62 score for non-identical amino acids are <=0.

Normalized score is calculated by dividing BLOSUM62 score by the number of amino acids in a sequence. As groups of sequences may have different length, normalized score can be used to compare the similarity between one group of sequences with other groups. 

Human and mouse, so similar, yet so different!
