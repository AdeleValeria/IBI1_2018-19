24 POINTS GAME

1. Ask the user to input any number between 1 and 23. Unlike the traditional 24 points game which normally requires 4 numbers, the user's input can be of any length.
2. Compute the numbers using all possible arithmetic expressions (+,*,- and /) to get 24.
3. Use a counter (var solution) to keep track of all possible math operations to reach 24.
4. Use a counter (global var count) to count calls in function.

The output:
*All possible math operations that give 24
*Error message is there is no solution found
*Recursion times

--------------Complexity Estimation-----------------
Input 1,2,3,4,5,6
There are 101566 ways to get 24
Recursion times: 80293544

Input 1,2,3,4,5
There are 1920 ways to get 24
Recursion times: 1247683

Input 1,2,3,4 (the result appeared almost instantly)
There are 212 ways to get 24
Recursion times: 22779

I assume the complexity for my code is O(2^N) because it starts off shallow, then rises meteorically with each addition to the input.
