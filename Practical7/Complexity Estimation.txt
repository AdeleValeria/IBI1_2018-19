24 POINTS GAME

1. Ask the user to input any number between 1 and 23. Unlike the traditional 24 points game which normally requires 4 numbers, the user's input can be of any length.
2. Compute the numbers using all possible arithmetic expressions (+,*,- and /) to get 24.
4. Use a counter (global var count) to keep track of the recursion times.

The output:
*Yes if there is at least a solution, no if there is no solution
*Recursion times

--------------Complexity Estimation-----------------
The complexity for my code is estimated to be O(4^(N-1))
The number started shallow, then rose significantly.
